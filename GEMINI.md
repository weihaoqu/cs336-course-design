# GEMINI.md

## Directory Overview

This directory appears to be for a course, likely "CS336", focused on Program Analysis for Security and Privacy. The projects involve using OCaml to build static analysis tools for identifying security vulnerabilities and privacy leaks in code.

## Key Files

*   `cs336/spec336projects.md`: This file contains the main information. It's a menu of potential course projects, including:
    *   Static Taint Analysis for Web Vulnerabilities
    *   Type-Based Information Flow Control
    *   Cache Side-Channel Detection
    *   Privacy-Policy Compliance Checker
    *   Symbolic Execution Engine
    *   AST-Based Secret & Misconfiguration Scanner
    *   Control-Flow Integrity (CFI) Auditor
    *   Memory Safety (Use-After-Free) Detector
    *   Privacy Leakage via "Taint Lite"

    It also provides a technical tutorial on core concepts like ASTs, CFGs, and data-flow analysis, and recommends tools like Dune, Menhir, and Z3.

## Usage

This directory seems to be for personal reference and study for the "CS336" course. It contains the project specifications and technical background needed to complete the course projects. It is not a software project with runnable code, but rather a set of specifications for projects to be built.
